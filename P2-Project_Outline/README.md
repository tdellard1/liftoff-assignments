### Overview
Have you ever been in an awkward social situation where you wanted to get out of it but you couldn't without coming off disrespectful to the other party? Well you no longer need to deal with those dreadful awkward situations thanks to Pineapples! Pineapples(Kevin Hart Voice) is an app that will arrange for you to send yourself an urgent call and relay an urgent pre-recorded message from a mother, prison, hospital, etc. that will provide an excuse with justification for getting out of those awkward situations.

The idea came to me when I was at a young ladys house. I was over there for one thing and one thing only. She didn't know that was my motive and said we were unable to do said thing and I didn't want to be there anymore. I had to fake a phone call to leave without hurting her feelings. Then I thought if only there was an app that could allow me to fake that phone call more legit... then *light bulb*
